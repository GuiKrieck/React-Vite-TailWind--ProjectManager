## Project Manager
There is a video demonstration in case you want to see it: [YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfu-mk8pFE4) (it's in Portuguese).

It started with a simple challenge to practice a little bit of React, but it turned out to be something more. I developed this project to practice React, Tailwind CSS, and English (I am a Portuguese speaker). After finishing it, I felt like it was missing something, so using Node.js, Express, and CORS, I decided to give it a kind of "back end."

The code may be a little messy since I'm striving to be a front-end developer and it was my first time dealing with "back-end"code, but it was quite a challenge to implement, in the end There was a lot of research and reading documentation, and I received some help from AI. It has finally been "completed."

Maybe I'll work some more on it and add a search field to find projects or implement a project history feature so the user can keep track of completed projects. I could also make the app warn the user when a project is almost due or the project is already due and not flagged as completed yet. That would be cool. But I have some other ideas I want to get out of my head, so for now, this is done.

Feedbacons are welcome... I mean feedbacks.

PS.:Dont forget to "npm install" this after clonning, both in the backend folder and in the front-end wich is the main path.
